Got the IBM4 working with an earlier version of Code.py and 
an earlier version of the UF2 file

16 - 5 - 2024
Updated the IBM4 with Frank's Code.py
Updated the UF2 file (version 8.2.6)
Can get comms via LabVIEW and PuTTY but can't get correct comms via MSVS
Suspect that the problem is the UF2 file
Code is throwing errors when attempting to call instr.clear() which was previously working
Try an earlier version of UF2 (version 7.3.3)
Earlier version of UF2 file fixes the problem
Instr.clear now works as expected

When switching between operating via MSVS and operating via LabVIEW the LabVIEW will throw 
"Can't Find Device" Error. This is spurious, and can be reset by opening LabVIEW comms in debug mode.
I don't know what the cause is.
